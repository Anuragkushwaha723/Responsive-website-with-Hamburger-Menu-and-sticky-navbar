          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy
          initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education
          policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s
          constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976
          made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central
          and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and
          administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with
          28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential
          for variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and
          initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
          policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
          state-level programs and policies. State governments and local
          government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary
          schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is
          growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private
          bodies is growing. Of those schools managed privately, one third are
          ‘aided’ and two thirds are ‘unaided’. Enrolment in Grades 1-8 is
          shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio
          73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in
          urban areas much lower.

          In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
          for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission
          surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for
          female.This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53%
          and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. India's improved
          education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its
          economic development.Much of the progress, especially in higher
          education and scientific research, has been credited to various public
          institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased
          steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)
          of 26.3% in 2019,there still remains a significant distance to catch
          up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,a
          challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to
          reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young
          population.

          Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of
          teacher absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private
          (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private
          schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools.
          Government ‘recognition’ is an official stamp of approval and for this
          a private school is required to fulfil a number of conditions, though
          hardly any private schools that get ‘recognition’ actually fulfil all
          the conditions of recognition. The emergence of large numbers of
          unrecognised primary schools suggests that schools and parents do not
          take government recognition as a stamp of quality.
